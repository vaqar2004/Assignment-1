      <h1 class="w3-center">About Me </h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">born in Feb, 5,2004 </h5>
      <p class="w3-large">I was born in a small town in India, where I grew up surrounded by wide-open fields and a tight-knit community. My childhood was filled with outdoor adventures, from building treehouses to playing sports with friends. As I got older, I developed a passion for football and started playing football. This love for football led me to join a local team in high school, and we played at various venues in our area. After graduation, I pursued a degree in computer science from Centennial College in a nearby city.  <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span> </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"> College life exposed me to new experiences and people from diverse backgrounds. In my free time, I still enjoy playing football and exploring the outdoors, but I also like to travel and try new cuisines from around the world. My life has been a journey of self-discovery, filled with both challenges and moments of joy, and I look forward to the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
